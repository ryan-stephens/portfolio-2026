WHAT I'M PROUD OF
======
My Decision Making Skills
Strong at evaluating technology tradeoffs and selecting the right tools for each challenge. Whether choosing between REST vs. gRPC, evaluating state management solutions, or deciding on deployment strategies, I research thoroughly and make pragmatic decisions that balance technical excellence with business needs.

My Focus & Persistence
Known for driving complex projects to completion despite technical challenges. Successfully migrated QAT's enterprise .NET application from AWS to Azure solo with zero downtime, and managed weekly TMS 2.0 production deployments at KBX across microservices with tight deadlines and rollback scenarios. I don't give up when encountering obstacles - I research solutions, leverage AI tools, and persist until delivering quality results.
