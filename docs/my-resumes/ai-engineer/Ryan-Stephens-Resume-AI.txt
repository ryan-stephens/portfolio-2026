WHAT I'M PROUD OF
======
My Decision Making Skills
Strong at evaluating technology tradeoffs and selecting the right tools for each challenge. Whether choosing between REST vs. gRPC for API design, evaluating state management solutions (NGRX vs. alternatives), or deciding on deployment strategies (Kubernetes vs. serverless), I research thoroughly, weigh trade-offs, and make pragmatic decisions that balance technical excellence with business needs. This analytical approach extends to leveraging AI-augmented development tools (Windsurf, Cursor, Claude) to accelerate learning new frameworks while maintaining code quality.

My Focus & Persistence
Known for driving complex projects to completion, even when facing technical challenges or ambiguity. When migrating QAT's enterprise .NET application from AWS to Azure solo, I worked through integration issues, infrastructure differences, and deployment complexities to deliver successfully with zero downtime. When managing weekly TMS 2.0 production deployments at KBX, I coordinated releases across microservices, handled rollback scenarios, and ensured reliable delivery despite tight deadlines. I don't give up when encountering obstacles - I research solutions, leverage AI tools to accelerate problem-solving, and persist until I've delivered a quality result.
